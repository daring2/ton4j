# TL Serialization

The implementation includes proper TL (Type Language) serialization for communicating with TON liteservers:

## Supported Queries

[queries](src/main/java/org/ton/ton4j/tl/liteserver/queries)

## Supported Responses

[responses](src/main/java/org/ton/ton4j/tl/liteserver/responses)

## Future improvements
Other non-liteservers TL types will be added later.
